Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

Nothing will print out since the memory is only storing the data but there
is nothing that is being called to do anything with the data so it is only being
stored in memory.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
